### Hi there! 👋  
### I'm Semi Babafemi — Quant Developer & Applied AI Researcher

Welcome to my GitHub!  
I'm currently completing my Master’s Degree in Applied Data Science at Syracuse University, while working as a Quant Developer at BNY Mellon.

#### 🌟 What I'm Currently Working On:
- **Climate & Commodities Research**:  
  Exploring the impact of climate variability on global agricultural commodity markets.  
  Developed a hybrid modeling approach combining **Random Forests** for predictive accuracy with a custom **Markovian Momentum Model (MMM)** to capture regime shifts and external shocks like COVID-19.  
  Focused on delivering interpretable, resilient forecasts in highly dynamic environments.

- **Harvey - Outbreak Detection System**:  
  Designed and deployed **Harvey**, a lightweight clinical assistant for early COVID-19 detection from unstructured medical text.  
  Built a two-stage pipeline that uses **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** to extract clinical symptoms and **BioBERT** fine-tuning to predict infection likelihood, enabling faster triage decisions and supporting clinicians during diagnostic bottlenecks.

- **Agentic AI Systems for Finance**:  
  Designing chain-of-thought-driven LLM agents that interact with financial models (CCAR, callable bonds, risk frameworks) at BNY Mellon.

- **Deep Learning Exploration**:  
  Researching wide & deep networks, optimization schedules (1cycle), and activation functions like Mish, Swish, and GELU for robust model training.
